            In this experiment, you will will go birdwatching in three locations. In each location, there will be three spots where you can look for birds.
            Different spots might have more or fewer birds, or birds of different rarity. You will spend five days in each location and in each day you get
            to choose which spot to look in. The birdwatchers' association will give you a reward for spotting birds, and a higher reward for seeing rarer birds.
        </p>

        <p>
            You don't know how many birds, or what type, there are in each spot beforehand.
            However, you get a chance to learn from expert birdwatchers who are familiar with the location before deciding what spots to watch in.
            Before you go birdwatching, you will see a list of expert birdwatchers with the scores they achieved.
            You will get to choose 5 birdwatchers to learn from. When you learn from an expert, you get to see the last three spots they looked in.
        </p>

            You will be paid a bonus of up to 75¢ based on the total reward you earned in this experiment. Each point of reward translates to 1¢.
